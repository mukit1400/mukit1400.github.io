## About

> Hi! I'm Mir, I teeter between product, engineering, and marketing. 

I have worked in both digital marketing and digital product design. I love building usable, accessible, and memorable experiences for everyone online, and then finding how to reach the right audiences through the right digital strategy. I am a Computer Science and Electrical Engineering graduate, I have a passion of finding what makes thing tick and building on them – from building VR experiences that pair with biometric data to building experiences with the shiny new web framework (it’s hard to keep up!).
